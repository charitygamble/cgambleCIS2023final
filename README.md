Charli Gamble
Final Project for CIS 2023 Linux

This is a simple bash script that counts to 50 and outputs the count on the terminal screen.

To use this script:
1. Clone repository to your computer
2. CD (change directory) into the repository directory.
3. Change permission to make file executable = chmod +x charlig.sh
4. Run bash script with ./charlig.sh

That's it! If you have any questions or need any help, contact me at charity@charitygamble.dev!
Thanks!
